###  Time_Series Data Forecasting (END TO END)
This is my take on Time Series Data. Taking Sunspot data, I have tried to explain every step involved and links are provided for further study.
#### Concept covered:
#### EXAMPLE1: Sunspot Data
1) Time series Exploratory Analysis
2) Concepts of different Averages used for approximating TS
3) lag plots
4) Stationarity
5) Autocorrelation/Partial autocorrelation
6) How to select (p,q) for ARIMA models
7) AutoArima
8) Forecasting a few time steps in the future.
9) Many other helping operations in pandas
#### EXAMPLE2: ENZ_DATA (Daily Energy consumption Data for one year of a Data Center at IITD)
10) One Non-stationary data is also analyzed where stationarity is achieved through the decomposition and trend is subtracted.ENZ_DATA_CENTER
11) Converting predicted value back to its original scale.
#### EXAMPLE3: Air Passenger Data
12) In this example Stationary is achieved through log and differenciation.
13) After prediction for conveting back to its original scale cumsum and antilog steps are taken.
